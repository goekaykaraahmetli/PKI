# YOLOv8 on AMD ROCm

This repository contains code for training and deploying a YOLOv8 object detection model using an AMD RX 7900 XT GPU with ROCm 6.3.3. The project includes scripts for training the model as well as for running inference on videos, including options to display class-specific colored bounding boxes.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to train and deploy a YOLOv8 object detection model using an AMD RX 7900 XT GPU under ROCm on Linux. Due to limitations with ROCm support on Windows, the project was eventually run natively on Linux (dual-boot) to fully leverage GPU acceleration.

## Prerequisites

- **Operating System:** Linux (Dual-boot recommended for native GPU support)
- **GPU:** AMD RX 7900 XT
- **ROCm:** Version 6.3.3 (or compatible; see [ROCm Installation Guide](https://rocmdocs.amd.com/en/latest/Installation_Guide/Installation-Guide.html))
- **Python:** Version 3.10 (recommended for compatibility with ROCm-enabled builds)
- **Virtual Environment:** Either `conda` or Python `venv`

## Required Libraries and Versions

- **PyTorch:** ROCm-enabled build (e.g., version 2.6.0+rocm6.3 or similar)
- **torchvision:** ROCm-enabled version corresponding to your PyTorch build
- **torchaudio:** ROCm-enabled version
- **Ultralytics YOLO:** Version 8.3.91 (installed via pip)
- **OpenCV:** `opencv-python` (version 4.x)
- **numpy:** Version â‰¤ 2.1.1 (to satisfy Ultralytics YOLO dependency)
- Additional dependencies (installed via pip): filelock, fsspec, jinja2, networkx, etc.

## Installation

### 1. ROCm 6.3.3 Installation

Ensure that ROCm is properly installed on your system. Verify that your GPU is recognized by running:

```bash
/opt/rocm/bin/rocminfo | grep 'Name'
